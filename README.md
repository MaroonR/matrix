# Matrix Class
-----------------------------
### An embedded Matrix class for use in aviation-specific embedded systems
This simple matrix library is capable of
* addition
* multiplication
* computing cofactor matrices
* solving determinants
* finding inverse matrices

These operations are heavily used in Kalman filters, which is the intended use of this library.
